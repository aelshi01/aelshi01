## Who Am I?

:computer:	 I am a data scientist who loves everything AI

:mortar_board:	Graduated with a MSc Data science in 2020

:closed_lock_with_key:	Cybersecurity Research intern at the cybersecurity lab for Birkbeck Institute of Data Analytics

:mortar_board:	I graduate with a Mathematics degree from King’s College London

:runner:	Competed in a national dual Athlon competition as a part of King’s College London

:kr:	Lived in South Korea for a university term (3 months) where I studied Korean, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Philosophy 


## How has data improved my life?

1.	Lost 15kg of fat and added 2kg of muscle in a 6 month period – By collecting a variety of data from wearable such as Fitbit (a step count), and applications like MyFitnessPal (calorie count) and a workout journal, I was able to make better, more informed, health and fitness decisions.

2.	As a part of the Mayor of London initiative I Created a Fundraising Campaign for my brothers business due to COVID impact – I was able to use great tools like google trends to come up with a more searchable friendly title for the campaign to increase exposure and traffic to our fundraising page.  Also, I used the data from Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Facebook to make better marketing decision regarding the fundraising and to increase our National reach.

3.	Increase in profit and efficiency for a FoodTech startup – at my time in Wowshee a food startup based in central London, I was able to create a basic recording system to record sales and other variables.  Having collected the data, I was able to make more precise decision on stock control, product likeability and macro business decisions.  

4.	Created a self-driving car with minimal autonomous capabilities – As a part of my MSc project I was able to create a miniature self-driving car by using different sensors such as ultrasonic, infrared and Bluetooth module.  My next stage is to use a HDMI camera to make real time decision by training a CNN to recognize obstacles, traffic sign and vehicles.

5.	Generated my own data through Unit (game simulator) and trained a CNN to drive around a track – I used Behavior Cloning to teach the computer to drive around any track in the simulated game.  I done this by generating my own data in the game simulator, which I used to train a CNN to learn how to drive around any track virtually.  



## I am currently working on:

1.	A self-driving car (miniature toy car) that I built from scratch and attached different sensors to give it autonomous capabilities.  I will be trying different methods for creating this project: 

•	Transfer learning
•	Reinforcement learning 

2.	Machine vision project using raspberry pi and HDMI pi camera to generate images and use a CNN to detect faces

3.	Using a raspberry pi to create a smart mirror
